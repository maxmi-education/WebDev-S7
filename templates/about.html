    <h1>About Us</h1>
    <p>
        We are a small ICT class in the idyllic countryside of Luxemburg, where Python does not work as it should. Despite these challenges, our passion for technology drives us to explore web development and learn new skills together.
        </p>
        <p>
        Our group enjoys collaborating on creative projects, sharing ideas, and supporting each other as we overcome technical obstacles. Each lesson brings new opportunities to grow and discover the possibilities of digital innovation.
        </p>
        <p>
        We believe that perseverance and teamwork are key to success in ICT. With curiosity and determination, we continue to build our knowledge and look forward to applying what we learn to real-world challenges.
